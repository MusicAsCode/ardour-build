# Introduction

A long time ago I used GarageBand to record music on a 2012 Mac Mini.  I forget
the audio interface I used, but it was not fancy at all.  I haven't done much 
recording since the GarageBand days, but I did recently get access to a ProTools
license, but then that old Mini finally went belly up.  The replacement has been a 
Linux laptop spec'd out for CGI and mahine Learning applications.  Not optimized for audio, but with plenty of 
relevant horse power in terms of CPU and RAM.
